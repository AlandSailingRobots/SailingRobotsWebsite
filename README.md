# New version of the SailingRobots Website

The website needs to be more user-friendly in order to be used by biologists.
To do that, the new UI should offer a clear view of measurements/samplings that 
would have been made on previous missions.

## Installation:
* [For Mac OS](INSTALL_MAC_OS.md)
* [Arch Linux](https://github.com/AlandSailingRobots/SailingRobotsDocs/blob/master/Website%20on%20localhost%20guide.md) :exclamation: __most likely outdated__

## Current Features :
   -  Current Website : https://sailingrobots.ax/aspire/ 
   -  Previous website : http://sailingrobots.com/testdata/live/
   -  Live logs
   -  Low level configuration
   -  Easy way to add waypoints (using LeafletJS and MapboxAPI)
   -  Logs monitoring

## What has been done so far :
