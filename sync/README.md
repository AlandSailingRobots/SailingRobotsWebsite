# Synchronisation interface between the boat and the server

This folder contains the files to run a synchronisation between the DB and the boat.
As I was running out of time, I simply adapted Janet code to ASPire. Some code re-
writing would be very welcome. (ie use the argument $boat to select between Janet
and ASPire instead of simply duplicating a big part of the code).
