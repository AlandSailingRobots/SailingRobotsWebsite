* New version of the SailingRobot Website

-> Current website : http://sailingrobots.com/testdata/live/

The website needs to be more user-friendly in order to be used by biologists.
To do that, the new UI should offer a clear view of measurements/samplings that would have been made on previous missions.

Current Features :

   -  Live logs
   -  Low level configuration
   -  Easy way to add waypoints (using Google Maps API)
   -  Logs monitoring

What needs to be done :

   -  New UI
   -  Graphs / tables with data
   -  More user-friendly interface for route planning
   -  "private" part for configuration
