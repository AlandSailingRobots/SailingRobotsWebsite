# JS Libraries

The following libs are used for the project

| Lib | Purpose |
| --- | ------- |
| bootstrap | for the responsive design of the website |
| jQuery | big framework to simplify JS development, used because the template needs it |
| font-awesome | provides nice icons |
| leafletJS | for the map display |

### Nota Bene :
*geomagnetism (could be used to automatically retrieve the magnetic declination of a point when it is saved into the DB but it requires NodeJS or a 'compatible interpreter')*

:exclamation: **The other libraries are not used. As long as they are not loaded into a HTML document, they won't do anything.**
